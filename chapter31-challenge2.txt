For identity, we want to show that the composition of an arrow a_1 with an identity arrow a_i is equal to a_1. We can check equality by assessing that the domain and codomain is unchanged after composition.

We have:

* dom a_1 = o_1
* cod a_1 = o_2
* a_i = η o_1
* dom a_i = cod a_i = o_0

Arrow composition is like regular function composition in that the resulting arrow must have the domain of the first arrow and the codomain of the second arrow. Therefore:

dom μ (a_1, a_i) = dom a_1

Since a_1 and a_i are composable, dom a_i = cod a_1. Therefore:

cod μ (a_1, a_i) = cod a_1

For associativity, just like regular function composition is associative, so is arrow composition. For any arrows a_1, a_2 and a_3, where cod a_1 = dom a_2 and cod a_2 = dom a_3:

μ (a_1, μ (a_2, a_3)) = μ (μ (a_1, a_2), a_3)
