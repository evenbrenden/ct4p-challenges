1. Consider to terminal objects a and b, with morphisms f and g between them, respectively, and where f is the inverse of g and vica versa. f . g must be the id for a and g . f must be the id for b. Both ids are unique per the definition of an id. Hence a and b are isomorphic. By the definition of a terminal object, f and g must also be unique. Hence this is the only isomorphism for a and b, and so they are unique up to unique isomorphism.
2. A product of two objects in a poset is a category with objects A, B and C and morphisms C -> A and C -> B, such that if C <= A/B and C <= A/B, then A/B is the same as C. Such a relation between C and A/B need not exist for all elements of the sets. Say there is an object D with projections D -> A and D -> B and also a morphism D -> C. Since there is at most one morphism between any pair in a poset, we can factorize like this: C -> A = D -> C -> A and C -> B = D -> C - > B. Therefore, C is "better" than D. D is not the product of A and B since there is no way to factorize D -> A and D -> B (again, since there is at most one morphism between any pair in a poset).
