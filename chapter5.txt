1. Consider to terminal objects a and b, with morphisms f and g between them, respectively, and where f is the inverse of g and vica versa. f . g must be the id for a and g . f must be the id for b. Both ids are unique per the definition of an id. Hence a and b are isomorphic. By the definition of a terminal object, f and g must also be unique. Hence this is the only isomorphism for a and b, and so they are unique up to unique isomorphism.
