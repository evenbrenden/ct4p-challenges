The set ((), Um) consists of functions that pick an element Umx in Um. There are as many functions in ((), Um) as there are different elements Umx in Um.

A homomorphism in Mon(F(), m) is determined by the fact that it can not contain more information than a number N, where N is the number of ()s. For each mx in m, such a morphism produces N times mx in m. That's the only homomorphism that can exist for a given mx, because that's all you can get out of F(). So Mon(F(), m) contains as many homomorphisms as there are different elements mx in m.

Since Um is the underlying set of m, the number of different elements mx in m is the same as the number of different elements Umx in Um.

Finally, F simply maps () to F().

Putting it all together, we must have that Mon(F(), m) â‰… Set((), Um).
