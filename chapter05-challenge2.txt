A poset/partially ordered set is one where morphisms are the <= relation between the objects in the set. There need not be a relation between all sets. For objects A and B and their product C in such a set, there are morphisms p1 :: C -> A and q1 :: C -> B, so C <= A and C <= B. For any other (potentially existing) object D with D <= A and D <= B, there is a morphism D -> C.

Let an object D have morphisms p2 :: D -> A and q2 :: D -> B. Then there exists an m :: D -> C and since there is at most one morphism between any pair of objects in a poset (unique relation), m factorizes p1 and q1 with m . p1 = p2 and m . q1 = q2. Therefore, C can be a product of A and B.

Now let's say that we have no morphism D -> C. Then there can be no n :: C -> D (and morphisms p1 = p2 . n and q1 = q2 . n) since there is at most one morphism between two objects and we already stated that if D exists, then we have D -> C. Therefore, we need m :: D -> C for C to be a product of A and B.
