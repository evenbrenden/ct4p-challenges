Generator: ()

The free monoid for this generator is Monoid [()]: [()] ++ [()] = [(), ()]

I suppose a lot of containers will do (that are isomorphic to list).

This is isomorphic with the monoid for integer addition:

h :: [()] -> Int
h unitList = length unitList

h_inv :: Int -> [()]
h_inv number = replicate number ()
