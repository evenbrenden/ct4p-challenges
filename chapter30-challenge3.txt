The hom-set L_(Mon)(2, 1) contains prototypes for all binary operations, where L_(Mon) is the Lawvere theory for monoids. The hom-set L_(Mon)(2, 1) is given by the hom-set Kl_T(1, 2), where Kl_T is a Kleisli category for a monad T. L_(Mon) generates the list monad T. Therefore, the list monad T can be generated using Kl_T(1, 2).
