The hom-set LMon(2, 1) contains prototypes for all binary operations, where LMon is the Lawvere theory for monoids. The hom-set LMon(2, 1) is given by the hom-set KlT(1, 2), where KlT is a Kleisli category for a monad T. LMon generates the list monad T. Therefore, the list monad T can be generated using KlT(1, 2).
