Challenge 1

Co-Yoneda embedding can be represented as:

(x -> a) -> (x -> b) ≅ a -> b

fromY :: (x -> a) -> x -> b
fromY f x = atob (f x)

fromY :: a -> b
fromY id = atob

Challenge 3

Let C be a monoid category with a single object a. The functor F :: a -> C(a, a) maps a in C to F(C, Set) and contains all morphisms C(a, a). The natural transformations that correspond to C(a, a) are Nat(C(a, a), C(a, a)) ≅ C(a, a). These natural transformations are identity transformations that map F(C, Set) to itself (see drawing).
atoa :: a -> a
atoa = id

fromY :: (a -> x) -> a -> x
fromY f a = f (id a) = f a

So fromY is just a transformation between Reader a x and Reader a x (that is, the very same functor).
