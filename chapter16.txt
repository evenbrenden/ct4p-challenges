Challenge 1

Co-Yoneda embedding can be represented as:

(x -> a) -> (x -> b) ≅ a -> b

fromY :: (x -> a) -> x -> b
fromY f x = atob (f x)

fromY :: a -> b
fromY id = atob

Challenge 3

Let C be a monoid category with a single object a. The functor F :: a -> C(a, a) maps a in C to F(C, Set) and contains all morphisms C(a, a). The natural transformations that correspond to C(a, a) are Nat(C(a, a), C(a, a)) ≅ C(a, a). These natural transformations are identity transformations that map F(C, Set) to itself (see drawing).
atoa :: a -> a
atoa = id

fromY :: (a -> x) -> a -> x
fromY f a = f (id a) = f a

So fromY is just a transformation between Reader a x and Reader a x (that is, the very same functor).

Challenge 4

Yoneda embedding: [C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) ≅ C(b, a)

The hom-set on the right hand side is a one-element set if b <= a, in which case there is exactly one natural transformation on the left hand side (by the Yoneda embedding). Otherwise, both sides are empty sets.

Since we can not map a singleton set to an empty set, if C(a, x) is a singleton set then so is C(b, x). In other words, if a <= x then b <= x, and the natural transformation [C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) exists. And if [C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) is a one-element set then C(b, a) is a one-element set, which means that b <= a.

All together:

b <= a if and only if for all x, a <= x implies that b <= x

Intuitively, this says that if b is less than or equal to a, then all x that are above than a must also be above b.
