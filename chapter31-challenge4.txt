(One last look at http://danshiebler.com/2018-11-10-category-solutions/, what would I have done without it?)

Given a monad T over an object a, a monad algebra is an algebra over T with a morphism alg :: Ta -> a that satisfies the coherence conditions.

For a monad in Span, we have:

* dom ∘ η = id
* cod ∘ η = id

Since η :: a -> Ta, dom or cod are both candidates for alg. Let's use dom.

First coherence condition:

alg . η =
id =
dom . η // Definition of η

Second coherence condition:

alg . μ_a $ (a1, a2) = // Apply a pairs of arrows (a1, a2)
dom . μ_a $ (a1, a2) = // alg = dom
dom a3 = // Definition of μ (using a3 as the apex of (a1, a2))
a1 = // a1 is the domain of a3
dom . T dom $ (a1, a2) = // dom . T dom :: T(Ta) -> a = fst
alg . T alg $ (a1, a2) // dom = alg
