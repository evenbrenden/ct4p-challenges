(One last look at http://danshiebler.com/2018-11-10-category-solutions/, what would I have done without it?)

Given a monad T over an object a, a monad algebra is an algebra over T with a morphism alg :: Ta -> a that satisfies the coherence conditions.

For a monad in Span, we have:

* dom ∘ η = id
* cod ∘ η = id

Since η :: a -> Ta, dom or cod are both candidates for alg. Let's use cod.

First coherence condition:

alg . η =
id =
cod . η // Definition of η

Second coherence condition:

cod . μ_a (a1, a2) =
cod a2 = // The codomain (output) of a2 . a1 is the codomain (output) of a2
cod . T cod (a1, a2) // IDK
