(One last look at http://danshiebler.com/2018-11-10-category-solutions/, what would I have done without it?)

Given a monad T over an object a, a monad algebra is an algebra over T with a morphism alg :: Ta -> a that satisfies the coherence conditions.

For a monad in Span, we have:

* dom ∘ η = id
* cod ∘ η = id

Since η :: a -> Ta, dom or cod are both candidates for alg. Let's use dom.

First coherence condition:

alg . η =
id =
dom . η // Definition of η

Second coherence condition:

dom . μ_a (a1, a2) =
dom a1 = // Domain of two composed arrows is the domain of the first of them
dom . T dom (a1, a2) // Lifted domain function picks the left arrow of a pair
