Challenge 5

Intuitively, we can always add arrows to the terminal object in the product diagram, which turns the diagram into a pullback. Intuitively, these diagrams are uniquely isomorphic.


Challenge 6

Conversely, intuitively, we can always add arrows from the initial object in the coproduct diagram, which turns the diagram into a pullback. Intuitively, these diagrams are uniquely isomorphic.
