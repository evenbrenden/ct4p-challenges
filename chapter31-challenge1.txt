We have:

f = a -> b = C(a, b) // Definition of a 1-cell
id_a = a -> a = C(a, a) // Identity endo-1-cell
C(a, a) ⊗ C(a, a) = C(a, a) // Tensor product defined as composition of endo-1-cells in a bicategory

And a relaxed set of monoidal laws in terms of:

p = f ∘ id_a -> f // Invertible 2-cell
q = id_a ∘ f -> f // Invertible 2-cell
r = (C(a, a) ⊗ C(a, a)) ⊗ C(a, a) -> C(a, a) ⊗ (C(a, a) ⊗ C(a, a)) // Invertible 2-cell

Left identity:

C(a, a) ∘ C(a, b) =
id_a ∘ f =
f = // By isomorphism
C(a, b)

Right identity:

C(a, b) ∘ C(b, b) =
f ∘ id_b =
f = // By isomorphism
C(a, b)

Associativity:

(C(a, a) ⊗ C(a, a)) ⊗ C(a, a) =
C(a, a) ⊗ (C(a, a) ⊗ C(a, a)) = // By isomorphism
