For example:

a :: () -- No morphisms other than identity morphisms
a = ()

fa1 :: Maybe ()
fa1 = Just ()

fa2 :: Maybe ()
fa2 = Nothing

alpha1 :: (() -> x) -> Maybe x
alpha1 ux = Just ux

alpha2 :: (() -> x) -> Maybe x
alpha2 ux =  Nothing

There are as many natural transformations from Reader () x to Maybe () as there are elements of Maybe () (that is, two).
