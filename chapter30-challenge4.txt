Consider a functor K :: Set -> FinSet such that for any finite set n in Set, we have Kn = n (identity). This means that the hom-set FinSet(Kn, a) = a^(Kn) = a^n.

Next, consider a finitary functor F (a functor that "(...) is fully determined by its action on finite sets.") The left Kan extension of F along K is:

LanKF a =
∫^n FinSet(Kn, a) x Fn =        // Since the target of K is FinSet
∫^n a^n x Fn =                  // As shown above
F                               // Action of F on an arbitrary set a

This means that the finitary functor F is the left Kan extension of itself along K.
