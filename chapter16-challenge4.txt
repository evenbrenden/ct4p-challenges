Yoneda embedding: [C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) â‰… C(b, a)

The hom-set on the right hand side is a one-element set if b <= a, in which case there is exactly one natural transformation on the left hand side (by the Yoneda embedding). Otherwise, both sides are empty sets.

Since we can not map a singleton set to an empty set, if C(a, x) is a singleton set then so is C(b, x). In other words, if a <= x then b <= x, and the natural transformation [C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) exists. And if [C, Set](C(a, -), C(b, -)) is a one-element set then C(b, a) is a one-element set, which means that b <= a.

All together:

b <= a if and only if for all x, a <= x implies that b <= x

Intuitively, this says that if b is less than or equal to a, then all x that are above than a must also be above b.
