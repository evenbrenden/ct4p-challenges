Challenge 1

psi . phi $ alpha =
psi (phi alpha) =
psi (alpha id) =
psi alpha id =
fmap id alpha =
alpha
=> psi . phi = id

Challenge 2

In this case, C(a, a) consists of a single point id :: a -> a, and so does Fa. By Yoneda's lemma, there is only a single natural transformation between C(a, -) and F.

Challenge 3

fa :: [()]
fa = [(), ()] -- For example

alpha :: (() -> b) -> [b]
alpha h = fmap h fa

h :: () -> Bool
h _ = True

anotherRepresentation :: [Bool]
anotherRepresentation = alpha h -- [True, True]
