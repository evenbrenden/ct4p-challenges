If f is non-injective, then the image of a in b contains less elements than a. This means that there is no way for the characteristic function to map every element of a to "true" in the classifying object, so pullback diagram won't commute. Therefore, if f is the pullback of true along the characteristic function, f cannot be non-injective, so it must be injective.
