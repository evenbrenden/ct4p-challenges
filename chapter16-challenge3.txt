Let C be a monoid category with a single object a. The functor F :: a -> C(a, a) maps a in C to F(C, Set) and contains all morphisms C(a, a). The natural transformations that correspond to C(a, a) are Nat(C(a, a), C(a, a)) â‰… C(a, a). These natural transformations are identity transformations that map F(C, Set) to itself.
atoa :: a -> a
atoa = id

fromY :: (a -> x) -> a -> x
fromY f a = f (id a) = f a

So fromY is just a transformation between Reader a x and Reader a x (that is, the very same functor).
