Consider to terminal objects A and B, with morphisms f and g between them, respectively. f . g  goes from A -> A and must therefore be the id for A, and g . f goes from B -> B and must therefore be the id for B. Every one part of A corresponds to some part of B in a one-to-one mapping, so they are isomorphic.

Per the defintion of a terminal object, f and g are unique. Also, both ids are unique per the definition of an id. So all morphisms are identical and unique. Hence A and B are unique up to unique isomorphism.
