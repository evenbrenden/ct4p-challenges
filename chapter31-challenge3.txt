(Just trying to wrap my head around the solution in http://danshiebler.com/2018-11-10-category-solutions/)

In Prof, the bicategory in which profunctors are 1-cells, a monad is an endo-profunctor T :: Cop x C -> Set (the hom-functor). The type signature follows from the definition of a profunctor and the fact that this is an _endo_-profunctor.

The composition of any profunctors p and q is defined in terms of a coend:

(q ∘ p) = ∫^c p c a x q b c

Composing T with itself:

(T ∘ T) c' c' = // Any c' in C
∫^c T c c' x T c' c = // Definition of profunctor composition
T c' c' // c is existentially quantified

This means that T maps any c's in C to itself. Which is another way of saying that T is an identity-on-objects functor.
